## Project Description
### Initial Consultation Questionnaire

### Purpose
 * To create a formal portal for organization wanting to host a WBGS- with the ultimate goal of *finding hosts that align with WBGS values*  
 * Retrieve information about candidates to be saved into a database- which could be used in other apps and send request to WBGS
 * Secondary - Create a dashboard to track client info and application status

### Scope
 * To provide WBGS with the tools to formally accept EOI’s with these deliverables
 * Send those details via email
 * Save those details to a MONGO database
 * To provide WBGS with a dashboard to manage EOI
 * Display EOI data
 * Shortlist candidates
 * Functionality & Features 
 * Application is able to take expressions of interest and submit data to a mailer and a database
 * Dashboard is available to view expressions of interest
 
### Functionality & Features 
The landing page makes use of videos, quotes, statistics and buttons that are highlighted . This is to draw potential host in and have them submit a expression of interest.

Application is able to take expressions of interest and submit data to a mailer and a database. User who submitted the form is sent a confirmation email and wgbs is sent and email with the data submitted.

Dashboard is available to view expressions of interest ,dashboard displays cards with each eoi printed out on them. Only the hosts name, organisation and date of the eoi is displayed on the cards. There is also a view button on each card that takes the eoi id  and sends  it through the router to the next section of dashboard which is the dashboard view. There is also a filter option to filter what eoi’s are displayed if they are either shortlisted or not.

Dashboard view is where the eoi’s data is fetched from the db and displayed to admin. There is a checklist along side the information that is there to check off if potential host meet wbgs criteria. Eois can be updated - shortlisted  and rejected. If an eoi is rejected the admin is prompt for a denial reason  which is then sent via email to candidate who submitted eoi explaining there rejection.

The Trello board can also be seen in full at: https://trello.com/b/dNKT0C4a/real-world-react-app

### Team Communication
Slack was used predominantly, and allowed for communication away from the common programming environment and out of hours. Outside of this,  Google Docs, GitHub comments, and in person communication were all used where possible

### Source Control Process
We used github as our source control software, and followed a fork workflow. 
Each contributor had their own fork of the pristine master branch, and checked out and worked on feature branches for different aspects of the application.
Completed feature branches were submitted for code review by at least two other contributors before a merge back into the master branch was allowed.

### Testing
 * Automated / Unit Tests - To be performed - had problems getting Jest & Mocha working with app
 * Regression Tests - To be performed
 * Integration Tests - To be performed  - had problems getting Jest & Mocha working with app
 
### Post Project Review
#### What did we enjoy?
 * The project itself, that it could be used by a really cool company / good cause
 * The project journey - it was great being able to see the project develop from a client’s ideas to completion
 * Functionality - It works!!
 * Splitting the work into two sprints - broke the work into modular, manageable work projects
 * Collaboration - we all did really well on our own project features which combined to make a great final project

#### What did we find challenging?
 * Authorisation / Security
 * Testing - frameworks did not seem to function well with the application (more learning required)
 * Communication with busy client - this made getting feedback and resources difficult when we needed to progress
 * Work life balance - difficulties balancing work, travel, sleep
 * Balancing project needs & client needs - we wanted to make the client happy, but also had to meet the project requirements
 * Team management - some team members live far away, or work overnight: it was hard for us all to meet together regularly

#### What did we learn?
 * Email setup, 
 * CSS transitions, 
 * CORS configuration, 
 * Express session management & Authentication, 
 * Redux forms, 
 * Semantic UI, 
 * Filtering Trello - effective for teams, 
 * Delving into Mongoose
 
## Questions:
#### What are the most important aspects of quality software?
#### Answer:

Three high-level areas of software quality, and some aspects within each are considered below:
 * Functional - How well does the software meet the needs of its users?
    - Usability / Accessibility - This concerns the intuitiveness of the user interface, and how well the software allows a user to do what they need to do, and how easy it is for a user to learn how to use it. It also encompasses their ability to access the software - for example, enabling users with disabilities, older devices, or low connection speeds to use an application.
 * Structural - How well does the software meet the needs of its owners?
    - Reliability - This relates to the likelihood of the software to withstand or manage interruptions in service such as failures or downtime. An unreliable software application reflects poorly on the perception and reputation of its owners, and could affect adoption. 
    - Efficiency / Performance - This considers how well the software consumes resources, which include (but are not limited to) CPU power, memory, and storage space. Poor performance can affect product perception, and increase costs for owners. 
    - Security - This concerns all factors in which the software could expose the software owners to risk. Security breaches can be particularly damaging to owners, and possibly even users who have personal information or other assets stored in the application.
 * Process - How well does the software meet the needs of developers?
    - Flexibility / Extensibility - This considers software adaptability, portability, and transferability. If not handled well, these can result in system damages, or entire rewrites of code when needs of the software change.
    - Maintainability / Readability - This relates to code testability, as well as how easy the code is to understand. Misunderstood code can cost developers unnecessary time and effort.

### Evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were in this project, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature?
### Answer: 
Some of the most effective skills we employed in the project were debugging and research skills, as these helped us to address problems with technologies we hadn’t encountered before, and to learn more about the expected performance of some of our libraries and frameworks. In addition to this, we felt that our excellent project planning assisted us in maintaining scope creep, thorough understanding of application requirements prior to development, and delegating features to team members. We also found that early deployment helped us to quickly identify and address problems (such as cross browser functionality and styling).
For future projects we would employ mobile first development and use Sass for styling. We also realised we would have greatly benefited from more deeper understanding of Redux, and testing frameworks such as Jest or Mocha.
