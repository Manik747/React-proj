## Project Description
### Initial Consultation Questionnaire

### Purpose
 * To create a formal portal for organization wanting to host a WBGS- with the ultimate goal of *finding hosts that align with WBGS values*  
 * Retrieve information about candidates to be saved into a database- which could be used in other apps and send request to WBGS
 * Secondary - Create a dashboard to track client info and application status

## Details of Project Management and Planning Process
### Project Sprints
The Project was divided into two sprints of a week each:
 - 1st - General Architecture and Expression of Interest Features
 - 2nd - Dashboard
 
### Project Planning Document

### White Boarding / Brainstorming Photos

### Project Timeline & Effort Estimation
Used Trello labels and dates to estimate:
 * Importance of Features to Client Deliverables and Scope,
 * Effort Required (T-shirt sizes)
 * Task Dependencies
 * Task Assignment , and
 * Task Completion Dates
 
### Trello Board Screenshots

### Team Communication
Slack was used predominantly, and allowed for communication away from the common programming environment and out of hours. Outside of this,  Google Docs, GitHub comments, and in person communication were all used where possible

### Source Control Process
We used github as our source control software, and followed a fork workflow. 
Each contributor had their own fork of the pristine master branch, and checked out and worked on feature branches for different aspects of the application.
Completed feature branches were submitted for code review by at least two other contributors before a merge back into the master branch was allowed.

### Testing
 * Automated / Unit Tests - To be performed
 * Regression Tests - To be performed
 * Integration Tests - To be performed
 
### Post Project Review
#### What did we enjoy?
 * The project itself, that it could be used by a really cool company / good cause
 * The project journey - it was great being able to see the project develop from a client’s ideas to completion
 * Functionality - It works!!
 * Splitting the work into two sprints - broke the work into modular, manageable work projects
 * Collaboration - we all did really well on our own project features which combined to make a great final project

#### What did we find challenging?
 * Authorisation / Security
 * Testing - frameworks did not seem to function well with the application (more learning required)
 * Communication with busy client - this made getting feedback and resources difficult when we needed to progress
 * Work life balance - difficulties balancing work, travel, sleep
 * Balancing project needs & client needs - we wanted to make the client happy, but also had to meet the project requirements
 * Team management - some team members live far away, or work overnight: it was hard for us all to meet together regularly

#### What did we learn?
 * Email setup, 
 * CSS transitions, 
 * CORS configuration, 
 * Express session management & Authentication, 
 * Redux forms, 
 * Semantic UI, 
 * Filtering Trello - effective for teams, 
 * Delving into Mongoose
 
## Questions:
#### What are the most important aspects of quality software?
#### Answer:

Three high-level areas of software quality, and some aspects within each are considered below:
 * Functional - How well does the software meet the needs of its users?
    - Usability / Accessibility - This concerns the intuitiveness of the user interface, and how well the software allows a user to do what they need to do, and how easy it is for a user to learn how to use it. It also encompasses their ability to access the software - for example, enabling users with disabilities, older devices, or low connection speeds to use an application.
 * Structural - How well does the software meet the needs of its owners?
    - Reliability - This relates to the likelihood of the software to withstand or manage interruptions in service such as failures or downtime. An unreliable software application reflects poorly on the perception and reputation of its owners, and could affect adoption. 
    - Efficiency / Performance - This considers how well the software consumes resources, which include (but are not limited to) CPU power, memory, and storage space. Poor performance can affect product perception, and increase costs for owners. 
    - Security - This concerns all factors in which the software could expose the software owners to risk. Security breaches can be particularly damaging to owners, and possibly even users who have personal information or other assets stored in the application.
 * Process - How well does the software meet the needs of developers?
    - Flexibility / Extensibility - This considers software adaptability, portability, and transferability. If not handled well, these can result in system damages, or entire rewrites of code when needs of the software change.
    - Maintainability / Readability - This relates to code testability, as well as how easy the code is to understand. Misunderstood code can cost developers unnecessary time and effort.

 - JS / JSON / AJAX
 - Node.js
 - React
 - Third Party Software & API’s
 - Mongo / Mongoose
 - Email integration
 - Data validation

### Evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were in this project, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature?
### Answer: 
Some of the most effective skills we employed in the project were debugging and research skills, as these helped us to address problems with technologies we hadn’t encountered before, and to learn more about the expected performance of some of our libraries and frameworks. In addition to this, we felt that our excellent project planning assisted us in maintaining scope creep, thorough understanding of application requirements prior to development, and delegating features to team members. We also found that early deployment helped us to quickly identify and address problems (such as cross browser functionality and styling).
For future projects we would employ mobile first development and use Sass for styling. We also realised we would have greatly benefited from more deeper understanding of Redux, and testing frameworks such as Jest or Mocha.
